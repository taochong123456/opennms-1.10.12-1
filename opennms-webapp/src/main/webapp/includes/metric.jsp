  This page is included by other JSPs to create a table containing
  a row for each event passed in.  
  
  This page has one required parameter: node, a node identifier.
  Without this parameter, this page will throw a ServletException.

  It expects that a <base> tag has been set in the including page
  that directs all URLs to be relative to the servlet context.
